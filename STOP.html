        <h1>Vending Exposed</h1>
        <p>
            The vending machines in our school are unreliable at best and a complete waste of resources at worst. 
            These machines break down constantly, leaving students frustrated when they try to grab a snack or drink between classes. 
            <strong>Why should students pay for something that barely works half the time?</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
            Recently, the school made the baffling decision to install card readers on these vending machines. 
            This was an unnecessary and expensive upgrade that prioritizes profit over student needs. Instead of using those funds to improve vital school services like better lunch options, extracurricular activities, or classroom supplies, 
            the administration poured money into machines that already overcharge us for low-quality snacks.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>The worst part?</strong> The vending machines are making obscene profits, and none of it seems to be going back to improve our school. 
            The gross profit from these machines is truly <strong>gross.</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
            - Drinks and snacks are marked up 200-300%, turning every purchase into pure profit. <br>
            - The money earned doesn't directly benefit the students. <br>
            - The machines break down so often that they spend more time "Out of Order" than helping anyone.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>We Deserve Better.</strong> These vending machines are a perfect example of misplaced priorities. 
            Instead of focusing on what the students actually need, the school is using these machines as a cash grab. 
            It's time to <strong>stop the madness</strong> and demand transparency. Where is the money going? Why are our funds being wasted on pointless upgrades when our classrooms still lack the basics?
